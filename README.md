Valuable code and exercises about the book "Constraint Handling Rules (2009)" by Thom Fr√ºhwirth.

Note that most of the examples in this book cannot work directly in SWI-Prolog (e.g. incomplete code, lacking necessary rules and built-ins, not compatible with flattening style, using different operation semantics, bugs, etc). The major purpose of this repository is to make them work, followed by some experiments and extensions.
